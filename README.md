## App description:
One of the biggest problems that comes with sharing a space with somebody else is the management of tasks. It can prove to be quite difficult to share the tasks around the house and keep track of them, and sometimes people even forget about them. So what can you do? I'm glad you asked.

## Features:
   - Creating a user profile (including eiting)
   - Creating a new group for your shared space (including editing and deleting)
   - Searching a group by its name or description
   - Requesting to enter a group (needs accept from the admin of the group)
   - Adding a new task to the group dashboard (including editing and deleting)
   - Assigning tasks to different members of the groups
   - Viewing all the tasks grouped by priority
   - Viewing all the tasks assigned to the current user
   - Adding a new expense to the group (inlcuding editing and deleting)
   - Calculating the total expense's price and how much each member has to pay
   - Resetting the expenses for the group
   - User-friendly calendar in the groups' dashboards


## Bug reporting:


## Automation Testing:
